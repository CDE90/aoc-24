# Advent of Code 2024

My solutions for [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024).

All written in Python using the `uv` package to run the code.

## Creating a new day

To create a new day, run the following command:

```bash
uv run new.py
```

This will create a new directory for the day, create a new file for the input, and create a new file for the code.

You will need to set the `AOC_SESSION` environment variable to the session cookie from the AoC website.

## Running the code

To run the code, run the following command:

```bash
uv run d1/d1.py
```

This will run the code for the first day.
